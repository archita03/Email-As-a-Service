This helps to send the emails using APIs. Database used here is MongoDB and its structure is as follows :-

{ "_id" : ObjectId("58f2682c973b089eaccb38a1"), "user_id" : 1000001, "key" : "8XINr4nuPeEud91pxwhSg54ScU8", "email_left" : 100, "personal_details" : { "first_name" : "archita", "last_name" : "kale", "role" : "developer", "company" : "individual", "git_link" : "https://github.com/archita03/" } }
